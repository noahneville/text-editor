# Just Another Text Editor

J.A.T.E is a light-weight text editor that can be used in the browser or installed for offline use.
## Description 

This is a simple text editor built to get a better understanding of progressive web applications. It makes use of service workers for caching purposes, webpack to build a deployable application, and with indexedDB it can be installed to be used offline without losing anything you've stored previously. 

## Usage and Installation


The simplest way to use this application is by viewing it deployed live on the web, available [here.](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/rocky-citadel-45599)

To download the webapp for offline use, you can either hit the "Install!" button in the top left of the nav bar, or you can click the install icon in the URL bar. Both are circled in red in the screenshot of the webapp pictured below:
